\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em Represents an edge in a graph This class represents an edge in a graph. Each edge has a source point (pointA), a destination point (pointB), a capacity (the maximum flow it can support), a current flow, a residual capacity (the remaining capacity after some flow has been passed through the edge), and a service string (which describes the service provided by this edge). \end{DoxyCompactList}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
